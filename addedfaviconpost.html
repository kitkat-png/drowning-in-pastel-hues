        <h2>Added a Favicon</h2>

        <p>In case ya didn't notice, I added a favicon to this website! It's the trans flag but in the shades of pink and blue of this blog.</p>

        <p>Actually, I just tried adding the favicons to neocities and it didn't work for some reason. Literally every tutorial I've found has said to do it the way I'm doing it, so I don't know what's wrong. Is it the fact I'm using a png?</p>

        <p>Update (5:16 PM): the problem's solved! Replaced the png with an ico file and it now works.</p>
