            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Hello. Welcome one and all to my personal website. This is where I put silly little things and stuff. I haven't fully decided what I'm gonna put here, but we can go on that adventure together.</p>

            <img id="persona-collar" src="images/persona-collar.png" alt="black cat drawn in a very simple lineless style wearing a pastel blue collar with a light gray heart shaped tag and a smile">
            
            <p>I've been really interested in web design, specifically web design that's more artsy and less corporate type boring stuff. As I keep this site going you're gonna be watching as I slowly learn how to make my sites less boring looking. It's annoying since all the tutorials I find just tell ya the very basics. I already know the basics, I wanna know how to make stuff look cool.</p>

            <p>I made this website myself, so if some bits are a bit wonky then that's my fault. I'm gonna try to make this website accessible and mobile compatible, but if I fail at that then I'm sorry. I'm hoping to go to school for web development, so maybe after that my website will become better.</p>

            <p>Also, here's a warning that there will probably be triggering things like cursing on this site. Things other than cursing will have trigger warnings before them so you can easily avoid them.</p>

            <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://neocities.org/site/drowning-in-pastel-hues">neocities profile</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/kitkat-png/drowning-in-pastel-hues">github repository for this site</a> so you can tell me if I'm doing anything major wrong and where I'm doing that if ya want to.</p>
