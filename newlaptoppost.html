        <p>I got a new laptop and it's been really good other than battery life. I got a thinkpad T440 and I have Linux Mint on it. I've basically been able to get all the software I loved on my mac on here. The only big loss has been the flash drive I used to install it because I don't know how to take Linux Mint off of it now that I'm done using it for that.</p>

        <p>People talk about Linux being really hard to install but I honestly didn't even need most of the notes I got from tutorial videos before installing it. After installing it I was surprised to find that the most important things I took notes on were explained on the welcome screen.</p>
