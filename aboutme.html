                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <p>Here is some general information about me!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I don't feel like any names fit me</li>
                    <li>I am 20 years old</li>
                    <li>I use they/it pronouns plus some neopronouns I only share with people I really trust</li>
                    <li>I am autistic (like the subtitle on this site says) and I struggle with mental health issues</li>
                    <li>I am aroace (aromantic asexual)</li>
                    <li>I'm cupioromantic (romance favorable) and apothisexual (sex repulsed)</li>
                    <li>Don't use female specific terms for me. Feminine compliments that aren't specifically female like cute and beautiful are cool, though.</li>
                    <li>I'm otherkin! This means I identify as nonhuman. Before hating on me for this, educate yourself on what being otherkin means using sources that aren't biased against otherkin.</li>
                    <li>I won't be sharing the specifics of what I identify as species-wise at the moment but the black cat on the screen is a cat made of shadow and is my persona, so that tells ya a bit.</li>
                    <li>I only share the specifics of my genders with those I trust. Y'all can know that I'm trans and bigender, though.</li>
                </ul>
