        <h2>Even More Updates</h2>
        <p class="date">Date posted: Sat April 5th 2025, 6:29 PM</p>
    
        <p>I've got even more updates to share.</p>

        <p>I reconfigured the 'rambles' page so that each invidual post was its own page. This was kinda annoying to do but worth it because I'm hoping to be able to make longer posts.</p>

        <p>Also, I managed to make Minecraft work on my new laptop but for some reason the Steam app won't work. Is anybody else having a problem where you can only login on the steam website but not any kind of app? (Like the desktop app and the mobile one)</p>

        <p>I love how my new laptop has keys that are more clicky than the ones on my last laptop. I missed clickier keys!</p>

        <p>I love it how Firefox just had an update that introduced tab groups! As someone who often has tons of tabs open this is a lifesaver. This way I can have a group for Ao3 tabs, a group for Youtube tabs- the sky is the limit!</p>

        <p>Also, my life's been kinda annoying recently, but I'm hoping to start adding cool new things to this website! Maybe I'll even add a page with a few really simple games like a guess the number game.</p>

        <p>To everybody reading this: good luck in your journies through life.</p>
