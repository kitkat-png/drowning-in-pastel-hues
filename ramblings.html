            <p>Hello! This is basically a little blog. May be big one day, who knows. Below here are links that will send you to each post. I may get enough posts one day for there to be multiple pages, but I'll figure out how to deal with that when we get there.</p>

                <h3>Added a favicon!</h3>
                <p class="date">Date posted: Fri March 7th 2024, </p>

                <p>In case ya didn't notice, I added a favicon to this website! It's the trans flag but in the shades of pink and blue of this blog.</p>

                <p>Actually, I just tried adding the favicons to neocities and it didn't work for some reason. Literally every tutorial I've found has said to do it the way I'm doing it, so I don't know what's wrong. Is it the fact I'm using a png?</p>

                <p>Update (5:16 PM): the problem's solved! Replaced the png with an ico file and it now works.</p>

                <p>I'm starting to add drawings to this website! For example I changed the background to a drawing I made and added a few drawings of my persona to the 'About Me' page.</p>

                <p>This is my first post on this website. This site used to be a website called 'My Little Hole in the Ground' but I decided to completely remake it and give it a new name. I remade it from the ground up only using small parts of the old site so I consider it its own thing.</p>

                <p>I am considering adding simple drawings to this website, but I'll start working on that later on.</p>
