        <h2>Some Updates</h2>

        <p>I'm hoping to get a new laptop that's easier to deal with than my current one. I'm hoping to get one that's cheaper than my current one too so that if I end up having to replace that one it won't suck as much. My current laptop is also having an issue where I can't update it cuz I don't have enough storage and then it buffers cuz it's not on the latest software update. I can't even play Minecraft anymore cuz it buffers too much.</p>

        <p>Maybe I can even get a laptop that's good enough for me to play The Sims 4 again. I don't even download that much custom content, so it's not like it'd be a ton of work for the computer, right?</p>

        <p>Also, I'm hoping to get some stuff to build up my dream look at some point. I wanna get a cat ear headband, a belt tail, and those little things I see people use to make it look like they have fangs. Basically, I wanna be an irl catboy and I don't care if others think it's weird cuz it's gonna make me super happy.</p>
